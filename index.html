            <h4>Section 3: Disability</h4>

            <p>We welcome applications from disabled people. Please tell us if you have a disability, including sensory or mobility impairments, long-term mental health conditions, longstanding illnesses or health conditions, autism spectrum conditions, or specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia, dyspraxia and ADHD, so that we can tell you about what study support is available if you are offered a place here.</p>

            <p>We will not take this information into account when assessing your application, which will be judged on academic merit and potential alone. Your personal information will be treated in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and related UK data protection legislation.

            <p>If you accept a place here, we will need to share this information with key individuals in academic, administrative and support roles in order to provide effective support. This will mean sharing your information with our Disability Advisory Service so that they may work with you to put in place any necessary adjustments or provide study support.</p>

            <p>You should contact the Disability Advisory Service (<a href="www.ox.ac.uk/students/welfare/disability" target="_blank">www.ox.ac.uk/students/welfare/disability</a>) as soon as possible if you wish to discuss this section, or anything to do with provision for disability-related support for your course.</p>

				</p>

				<p class="section-content">
					We set out below those circumstances where it is necessary for us to process your data. (These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)
				</p>

				<h4 class="section-title">6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application</h4>
				<p class="section-content">
					Information processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.
				</p>
				<p class="section-content">
					We also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors. See section 8 for a fuller list of examples of third party sharing.
				</p>

				<h4 class="section-title">6.2 Where we need to comply with a legal obligation</h4>
				<p class="section-content">
					Information processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the monitoring of equal opportunities. We are also required by law to provide data to various Government departments through the <a href="#">Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA)</a>.
				</p>

				<h4 class="section-title">6.3 Where it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests</h4>
				<p class="section-content">
					We also need to process your data in order to meet our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:

				<h4 class="section-title">6.4 Where we have your consent</h4>
				<p class="section-content">
					There may be situations where we ask for your consent to process your data, for example, the socio-economic questions in the application form and pre-application communications for student recruitment purposes (you will always be able to opt out of receiving such communications).
				</p>

				<h4 class="section-title">If you fail to provide personal information under 6.1 or 6.2 above</h4>
				<p class="section-content">
					If you fail to provide certain information when requested under the circumstances described in 6.1 and 6.2 above, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligation to consider your application or to comply with our other legal obligations.
				</p>

				<h4 class="section-title">Change of purpose</h4>
				<p class="section-content">
					We will only process your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

				</p>
				<p class="section-content">
					Please note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
				<h4 class="section-title">7. Special category data and criminal conviction data</h4>
				<p>Special category data and criminal conviction data require a higher level of protection. Listed below are examples of processing activities that we regularly undertake in respect of these types of data. In addition to the activities listed below, it may sometimes be necessary to process this sort of information for exceptional reasons, for example, because it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

				<p>Data about certain unspent criminal convictions, including whether or not you have such a conviction, is gathered during the process of applying for a course with us once you have been offered a place. Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.</p>
				<h4 class="section-title">7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief</h4>
				<p>Data about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equalities and other legislation.

				<h4 class="section-title">9. Transfer of your data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)[3]</h4>
				<p class="section-content">
					There may be occasions when we transfer your data outside the EEA, for example, to obtain a reference or to verify information in your application. Such transfers will only take place if one of the following applies:
					<ul>

				<p class="section-content">
					Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Request access to your data</strong> (commonly known as a "subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of your data and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
						<li><strong>Request correction of your data.</strong> This enables you to ask us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you.</li>
						<li><strong>Request erasure of your data.</strong> This enables you to ask us to delete or remove your data in certain circumstances, for example, if you consider that there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
						<li><strong>Object to processing of your data</strong> where we are relying on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your data for direct marketing purposes.</li>
						<li><strong>Request the restriction of processing of your data.</strong> This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your data, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
						<li><strong>Request the transfer of your data to another party.</strong></li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p class="section-content">
					Depending on the circumstances and the nature of your request it may not be possible for us to do what you have asked, for example, where there is a statutory or contractual requirement for us to process your data and it would not be possible to fulfil our legal obligations if we were to stop. However, where you have consented to the processing (for example, where you have asked us to send you certain types of communication), you can withdraw your consent at any time, by emailing us at graduate.admissions@admin.ox.ac.uk. In this event, we will stop the processing as soon as we can. If you choose to withdraw consent it will not invalidate past processing and it may impact our ability to provide particular additional services to you. Further information on your rights is available from the Information Commissionerâs Office(ICO) https://ico.org.uk/ . If you want to exercise any of the rights described above or are dissatisfied with the way we have used your information, please contact the Universityâs Information Compliance Team at data.protection@admin.ox.ac.uk. The same address can be used to contact the Universityâs Data Protection Officer. We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR. Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise. If you remain dissatisfied, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the ICO at https://ico.org.uk/concerns/.
				</p>
				<h4 class="section-title">12. Keeping your data up-to-date</h4>

				<h4 class="section-title">13. Changes to this privacy policy</h4>
				<p>We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time, and will seek to inform you of substantial updates. We may also notify you in other ways from time to time about the processing of your personal data.</p>
