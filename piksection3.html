                    Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Request access to your data</strong> (commonly known as a "subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of your data and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
						<li><strong>Request correction of your data.</strong> This enables you to ask us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you.</li>
						<li><strong>Request erasure of your data.</strong> This enables you to ask us to delete or remove your data in certain circumstances, for example, if you consider that there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
						<li><strong>Object to processing of your data</strong> where we are relying on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your data for direct marketing purposes.</li>
						<li><strong>Request the restriction of processing of your data.</strong> This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your data, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
						<li><strong>Request the transfer of your data to another party.</strong></li>
					</ul>
				</p>
                <p>Depending on the circumstances and the nature of your request it may not be possible for us to do what you have asked, for example, where there is a statutory or contractual requirement for us to process your data and it would not be possible to fulfil our legal obligations if we were to stop. However, where you have consented to the processing (for example, where you have asked us to send you certain types of communication), you can withdraw your consent at any time, by emailing us at <a href="graduate.admissions@admin.ox.ac.uk">graduate.admissions@admin.ox.ac.uk</a>. In this event, we will stop the processing as soon as we can. If you choose to withdraw consent it will not invalidate past processing and it may impact our ability to provide particular additional services to you. Further information on your rights is available from the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">Information Commissioner's Office</a>(ICO) <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">https://ico.org.uk/</a>.
